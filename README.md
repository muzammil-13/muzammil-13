## 📚 My Learning Journey

The path hasn’t been linear—but it’s been intentional.

### ⚙️ 2015–2020: The Curious Tinkerer

Before the degrees and dev tools, I was just a tech-obsessed teenager.  
Flashing custom ROMs, fixing desktops, troubleshooting phones, and diving deep into docs, YouTube tutorials, and XDA forums—that was my bootcamp.  
Linux terminals, recovery modes, and optimization tricks were my playground.

### 🎓 2020–2023: The Degree & Discovery

I pursued my **Bachelor of Computer Applications** through storms—literally.  
- 📚 First year: COVID lockdowns turned classrooms into browser tabs.  
- 🌊 Second year: flooded with academic pressure—exams, lab records, and uncertainty.  
- 💻 Third year: I got my first laptop—my gateway to exploring Linux admin, Android dev, and cloud computing.

### 🐍 2023: The Foundation Year

I kicked things off with a **Python Full Stack internship**—my first structured experience building both the frontend and backend of real-world apps.

### ⚡ 2024: The Launchpad

I participated in **IEEE Launchpad Kerala**, where I learned:  
- Frontend fundamentals  
- CTF Hackathon
- Problem-solvings in Coding
- Core engineering principles  
- Communication & collaboration during employability training  

### ☁️ 2024: Cloud & Code

Later that year, I earned **5+ skill badges** via the **Google Cloud PCA Cohort**, gaining practical experience with GCP services and infrastructure basics.

### 💼 2024: Corporate Readiness

The **EY GDS NextGen Emp Program** helped me refine my MERN stack capabilities while building real teamwork and soft skills that are critical in the workplace.

### 🚀 2025: Sharpening the Blade

I completed **89% of The Odin Project’s Web Foundations**, solidifying my understanding of full-stack architecture through project-based learning.

### 🧠 2025–Present: The SaaS Mindset

Now I’m part of **Micro SaaSkool**, focusing on:  
- MVP building  
- SaaS product thinking  
- Iterating with user feedback  
- Laying the groundwork for a meaningful tech product
